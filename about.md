# About the project

This project started on the evening of sunday, may 19, 2019.

I had just finished building a very cool [Pixel Lamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94nbqv7Jhlo) that I found on [Heliox](helioxlab)'s YouTube channel, and I was chatting with my friends [Dave](https://twitter.com/thelovebug) and [Jeroen](https://twitter.com/JeroenBaten).

I suggested that maybe I could "unwrap" the lamp and make a cool 16x8 flat screen. Jeroen immediatly suggested "Tetris !!!".

And that was it, the starting point for this crazy idea to build a 40cm x 1m Tetris board, using a 3D printer to print most of the parts. At that time, I was the only one with a 3D printer so they relied on my for that part, but we all collaborated on this project.

Dave suggested that we use a 7-segment dispay for the score board, I then suggested we add some kind of presence detector to shut the board down when no-one is in front of it, and to automatically turn it on in demo mode when someone stands in front of it.

We also agreed that it would need some sort of controller, but at that time, we didn't have any idea what form that could be.

This site will try to keep track of our design choices, our successes and failures, and hopefully end up with a cool video of a functionnal TetriXel board.

Time to go back to [the main page](/) !
